## Step 1
Add configuration file at
~/.aws/credentials

```
[profile-name]
aws_access_key_id = <access key id>
aws_secret_access_key = <access key secret>
```
## Step 2
Add a public key file path in variable.tf

```terraform
variable "pub-key-path" {
    ...
    default = "<your path>"
}
```
This can be generated by `ssh-keygen`. File with `.pub` extention is public key and to be send to the server, where the file with no extention is private key.
