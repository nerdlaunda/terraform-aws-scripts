## Step 1
Add configuration file at
~/.aws/credentials

```
[profile-name]
aws_access_key_id = <access key id>
aws_secret_access_key = <access key secret>
```
## Step 2
Add a public key file path in variable.tf

```terraform
variable "pub-key-path" {
    ...
    default = "<your path>"
}
```
This can be generated by `ssh-keygen`. File with `.pub` extention is public key and to be send to the server, where the file with no extention is private key.

## Step 3

Choose aws region

|Region Name|Region(value to use)|
|-----------|--------------------|
|US East (N. Virginia)|us-east-1|
|US East (Ohio)|us-east-2|
|US West (N. California)|us-west-1|
|US West (Oregon)|us-west-2|
|Asia Pacific (Tokyo)|ap-northeast-1|
|Asia Pacific (Mumbai)|ap-south-1|
|Asia Pacific (Singapore)|ap-southeast-1|
|Asia Pacific (Sydney)|ap-southeast-2|

> It's not the complete list of regions. Its the list of regions the this script is configured for.

## Final Step : Execution

Execute the command in the same directory.
1. _Prepare the required provides and initialize the directory._
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
2. _Prepare the required plan and order of execution by dependency. This also refresh the current state_
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
3. _Execute and provision the resources._
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
4. A successful execution will show Private IP and Public IP of the instance. The instance (webserver) can be accessed from browser at &lt;public-ip>:80
SSH is also enabled by default. Which is available at port 22 of &lt;public-ip> and accessible by private key.

> `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` can be used to format/beautify the source code and validatation.
